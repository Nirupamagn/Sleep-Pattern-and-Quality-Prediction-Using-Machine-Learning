This project predicts sleep quality based on lifestyle and health factors using multiple machine learning algorithms. It includes data visualizations, preprocessing, and comparison of five models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Due to limited and synthetic data, the model accuracy is around 50% and may improve with real-world data.
